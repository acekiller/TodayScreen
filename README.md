TodayScreen was created as a way to bring extensible widgets akin to Windows 7 live tiles to the iPhone.

The iPhone lacks "glance-able" information that allows users on the move to quickly pull out their phone and check things that are important to them. A user who wants to check new messages/emails will have to click on the messaging and email apps; to check news, will have to launch the news app; to check weather, will have to see the weather app; etc. TodayScreen attempts to solve the problem of having to launch different apps to check different things. The app allows user to add most common widgets on a screen so that user can quickly be informed of the latest information.
